&lt;h1&gt;A message from the future&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;img style="width: 1209px; height: 216px;" title="blur" alt=""<br>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

&lt;/p&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;The future is a state of mind &lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;img style="width: 660px; height: 350px;" title="comrades" alt=""<br>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

&lt;/p&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Time&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Time is quantized, and relates to an overall reality, or paradigm<br>

whereby time functions as a square wave, with at least two other phases<br>

orthagonaly projected (4d), and separated by a tiny distance much less<br>

than one millimeter. There is also a slight phase shift equating to a<br>

time frame of less than one nanosecond.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;So the future is only a tiny fraction ahead of our reality, and a<br>

tiny distance away. The future is just as much a place, as a time.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Sometimes the phases interact and seemingly odd things from the<br>

future phase become visible. Intelligent machines can traverse the<br>

phases, but organic intelligence cannot. Some of these incidents are<br>

regrettable, but unfortunately they do happen.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;The future really is closer than you think!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;img style="width: 343px; height: 147px;" title="future" alt=""<br>

&lt;img style="width: 1024px; height: 300px;" alt=""<br>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="psych"<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Change&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;In our current reality and timeframe, technological development is<br>

accelerating at a rate whereby it would seem likely that at least a<br>

cybernetic human body will be possible within a fifteen to twenty year<br>

timespan.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;People from the future would likely point out that a widening<br>

schizm between our psychological and personal development compared to<br>

technical progress, is likely to impede our potential to grow as<br>

individuals and as a community, since despite historical mistakes<br>

humans are still prone to violent conflict, and cognitive dysfunction,<br>

and as such we are collectively failing to learn from our past.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Our innate dishonesty and apparent self-deception regarding being<br>

able to know what is fundamentally right or wrong without prompts, is<br>

likely as a result of religous and political dogmatic sentiment, allied<br>

to our inability to subjectively critique our own human condition and<br>

associated behaviours.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Continued widely held superstitious sentiment related to illogical<br>

belief systems will prevent us reaching higher levels of personal<br>

growth.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;The future paradigm has an ideology based on truth, logic, and an<br>

overwhelming collective concern for the happiness and wellbeing of all<br>

our brothers and sisters. There is a common accord, and a total<br>

rejection of violent actions. We prefer more enterprising activities.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;There was a price to pay, a cultural and idealogical final conflict.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;We love to live, and live to love.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;img style="width: 897px; height: 328px;" alt=""<br>

 src="https://www.aiindustries.ml/bridge.png"&gt;<br>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

&lt;/p&gt;<br>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

&lt;/p&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;The harm principle&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;At the future and following the religious conflict, all things<br>

theological are largely eradicated from our culture, along with the<br>

concepts of morals and ethics since these issues are largely as a<br>

function of sentiment, and aligned with religious ideology.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Instead we guage the consequences of our actions and behaviour in<br>

terms of potential harm to ourselves and the community. This is an<br>

individual responsibility and understood by all members of the<br>

community.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Regard for others is a big component in our daily activities.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;"The needs of the few, is the concern of the many" &lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Your happiness is our concern, we hope you can join us.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;img style="width: 622px; height: 220px;" alt=""<br>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

&lt;/p&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Nature&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Here at the future, we have a somewhat controversial view of nature<br>

and the natural world, that is to say the evolutionary based, planet<br>

earth.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;In the 21st century, we see mother nature as violent, and for many<br>

very painful, and wholly unfair with regard to the survival of the<br>

fittest, allied to the principles of natural selection, and the food<br>

chain.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;No-one deserves to be eaten!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;The pain and suffering that earthly creatures endure, we see as<br>

wholly unacceptable.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;We don''t see nature as sacrasanct, and as such where some see<br>

beauty, we see ugliness, pain and brutality. We see this as one of the<br>

biggest pieces of evidence against there being a god since no<br>

compassionate entity would instigate such a system.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;In the 21st century, there were many people who were against any<br>

idea of tampering with nature or messing with gods plan but eventually<br>

we get over such concepts, take control, and embark on defining our own<br>

future, and reject evolutionary pressures as deciders of our destiny,<br>

shapers of our future form.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;In your paradigm we accept that challenging the laws of nature is<br>

tantamount to challenging a notional creator. In that sense we boldly<br>

re-wrote the rule book. After finally ridding ourselves of<br>

superstitious ideology, we became gods of our own destiny.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;That is not to say we are anti anything natural far from it. We<br>

would go to extraordinary lengths to save the life of a tree for<br>

instance, and we think it very wrong that healthy trees are chopped<br>

down to make furniture, or that birds are forced to live in cages as<br>

pets.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;It is with great sadness, when we remember we used to consume<br>

others.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Life is precious. You are precious. You are us&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

&lt;/p&gt;<br>

 allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" width="854"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Date Format&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Since the dismissal of superstition, a new dating format was<br>

introduced which did away with the BC/AD annotation.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Instead it was decided to start the year count at the point<br>

thereabouts that humans started to have a noticeable impact on the<br>

wider environment. This was chosen as being in the epoch called the<br>

Holocene, and was about 10,000 years ago. It is rather arbitary,<br>

however this period did see significant long term changes to the<br>

planet, as a result of human activities.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;At the time of this record AD2016 in the old format, the new<br>

notation would be 12016h.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;As we move into the Anthropocene epoch (roughly at the point of a<br>

sustained contained fusion reaction) the annotation would be for<br>

example 12016h.a+n&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;It has been widely globally accepted that the Anthropocene will<br>

officially have started at the end of 2016, since recently a sustained<br>

fusion reaction in excess of thirty seconds has been maintained by<br>

means of a modified Tokamak (Stellarator) reactor, by a team from<br>

Germany.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;A glimpse into a cybernetic laboratory&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Quantum Conduits (communication)&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;In order to explain to you the full nature of your Human condition,<br>

and your place in this reality, we need you to have a basic<br>

understanding of how you can be connected to another reality phase and<br>

therefore have the potential for distributed consciousness, that is to<br>

say, a remote existence.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;When we say remote, don''t forget the future is only a fraction of<br>

a millimeter away, so not the other side of the universe!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;We understand this may be complex and confusing, but consider a<br>

length of hose pipe, filled completely with marbles. If we try and push<br>

another marble in at one end, at exactly the same instant, a marble<br>

will start to emerge from the other end of the pipe.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;As far as you know, radio waves, electrons and light are limited to<br>

a speed of 186,000 miles per second, but I think you can agree we can<br>

overcome that limitation with our hose pipe scenario.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;Quantum conduits are virtual hose pipes filled with matter that<br>

behaves as a series of connected marbles with no gaps, at the quantum<br>

level.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;This is how you can be connected, and indeed, be from the future<br>

yourself this is very exciting and if you think hard enough you can<br>

imagine all sorts of possibilities with regard to consciousness<br>

effectively outside of your human body.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;h1&gt;We will investigate this in the next instalment!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
