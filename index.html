    <h1>A message from the future</h1>

    <h1>The future is a state of mind </h1>

    <h1>Time</h1>
    <h1>Time is quantized, and relates to an overall reality, or paradigm
      whereby time functions as a square wave, with at least two other phases
      orthagonaly projected (4d), and separated by a tiny distance much less
      than one millimeter. There is also a slight phase shift equating to a time
      frame of less than one nanosecond.</h1>
    <h1>So the future is only a tiny fraction ahead of our reality, and a tiny
      distance away. The future is just as much a place, as a time.</h1>
    <h1>Sometimes the phases interact and seemingly odd things from the future
      phase become visible. Intelligent machines can traverse the phases, but
      organic intelligence cannot. Some of these incidents are regrettable, but
      unfortunately they do happen.</h1>
    <h1>The future really is closer than you think!</h1>

    <h1>Change</h1>
    <h1>In our current reality and timeframe, technological development is
      accelerating at a rate whereby it would seem likely that at least a
      cybernetic human body will be possible within a fifteen to twenty year
      timespan.</h1>
    <h1>People from the future would likely point out that a widening schizm
      between our psychological and personal development compared to technical
      progress, is likely to impede our potential to grow as individuals and as
      a community, since despite historical mistakes humans are still prone to
      violent conflict, and cognitive dysfunction, and as such we are
      collectively failing to learn from our past.</h1>
    <h1>Our innate dishonesty and apparent self-deception regarding being able
      to know what is fundamentally right or wrong without prompts, is likely as
      a result of religous and political dogmatic sentiment, allied to our
      inability to subjectively critique our own human condition and associated
      behaviours.</h1>
    <h1>Continued widely held superstitious sentiment related to illogical
      belief systems will prevent us reaching higher levels of personal growth.</h1>
    <h1>The future paradigm has an ideology based on truth, logic, and an
      overwhelming collective concern for the happiness and wellbeing of all our
      brothers and sisters. There is a common accord, and a total rejection of
      violent actions. We prefer more enterprising activities.</h1>
    <h1>There was a price to pay, a cultural and idealogical final conflict.</h1>
    <h1>We love to live, and live to love.</h1>

    <h1>The harm principle</h1>
    <h1>At the future and following the religious conflict, all things
      theological are largely eradicated from our culture, along with the
      concepts of morals and ethics since these issues are largely as a function
      of sentiment, and aligned with religious ideology.</h1>
    <h1>Instead we guage the consequences of our actions and behaviour in terms
      of potential harm to ourselves and the community. This is an individual
      responsibility and understood by all members of the community.</h1>
    <h1>Regard for others is a big component in our daily activities.</h1>
    <h1>Your happiness is our concern, we hope you can join us.</h1>

    <h1>Nature</h1>
    <h1>Here at the future, we have a somewhat controversial view of nature and
      the natural world, that is to say the evolutionary based, planet earth.</h1>
    <h1>In the 21st century, we see mother nature as violent, and for many very
      painful, and wholly unfair with regard to the survival of the fittest,
      allied to the principles of natural selection, and the food chain.</h1>
    <h1>No-one deserves to be eaten!</h1>
    <h1>The pain and suffering that earthly creatures endure, we see as wholly
      unacceptable.</h1>
    <h1>We don''t see nature as sacrasanct, and as such where some see beauty,
      we see ugliness, pain and brutality. We see this as one of the biggest
      pieces of evidence against there being a god since no compassionate entity
      would instigate such a system.</h1>
    <h1>In the 21st century, there were many people who were against any idea of
      tampering with nature or messing with gods plan but eventually we get over
      such concepts, take control, and embark on defining our own future, and
      reject evolutionary pressures as deciders of our destiny, shapers of our
      future form.</h1>
    <h1>In your paradigm we accept that challenging the laws of nature is
      tantamount to challenging a notional creator. In that sense we boldly
      re-wrote the rule book. After finally ridding ourselves of superstitious
      ideology, we became gods of our own destiny.</h1>
    <h1>That is not to say we are anti anything natural far from it. We would go
      to extraordinary lengths to save the life of a tree for instance, and we
      think it very wrong that healthy trees are chopped down to make furniture,
      or that birds are forced to live in cages as pets.</h1>
    <h1>It is with great sadness, when we remember we used to consume others.</h1>
    <h1>Life is precious. You are precious. You are us</h1>

    <h1>Date Format</h1>
    <h1>Since the dismissal of superstition, a new dating format was introduced
      which did away with the BC/AD annotation.</h1>
    <h1>Instead it was decided to start the year count at the point thereabouts
      that humans started to have a noticeable impact on the wider environment.
      This was chosen as being in the epoch called the Holocene, and was about
      10,000 years ago. It is rather arbitary, however this period did see
      significant long term changes to the planet, as a result of human
      activities.</h1>
    <h1>At the time of this record AD2016 in the old format, the new notation
      would be 12016h.</h1>
    <h1>As we move into the Anthropocene epoch (roughly at the point of a
      sustained contained fusion reaction) the annotation would be for example
      12016h.a+n</h1>
    <h1>It has been widely globally accepted that the Anthropocene will
      officially have started at the end of 2016, since recently a sustained
      fusion reaction in excess of thirty seconds has been maintained by means
      of a modified Tokamak (Stellarator) reactor, by a team from Germany.</h1>

    <h1>Quantum Conduits (communication)</h1>
    <h1>In order to explain to you the full nature of your Human condition, and
      your place in this reality, we need you to have a basic understanding of
      how you can be connected to another reality phase and therefore have the
      potential for distributed consciousness, that is to say, a remote
      existence.</h1>
    <h1>When we say remote, don''t forget the future is only a fraction of a
      millimeter away, so not the other side of the universe!</h1>
    <h1>We understand this may be complex and confusing, but consider a length
      of hose pipe, filled completely with marbles. If we try and push another
      marble in at one end, at exactly the same instant, a marble will start to
      emerge from the other end of the pipe.</h1>
    <h1>As far as you know, radio waves, electrons and light are limited to a
      speed of 186,000 miles per second, but I think you can agree we can
      overcome that limitation with our hose pipe scenario.</h1>
    <h1>Quantum conduits are virtual hose pipes filled with matter that behaves
      as a series of connected marbles with no gaps, at the quantum level.</h1>
    <h1>This is how you can be connected, and indeed, be from the future
      yourself this is very exciting and if you think hard enough you can
      imagine all sorts of possibilities with regard to consciousness
      effectively outside of your human body.</h1>
    <h1>We will investigate this in the next instalment!</h1>
