    <h1>A message from the future</h1>
    <p><img alt="blur" src="website_images/blur.jpg" width="813"></p>
    <h1>The future is a state of mind </h1>
    <h1><img alt="comrades" src="website_images/comrades.jpg" height="269" width="660"></h1>
    <h1>Time</h1>
    <h1>Time is quantized, and relates to an overall reality, or paradigm
      whereby time functions as a square wave, with at least two other phases
      orthagonaly projected (4d), and separated by a tiny distance much less
      than one millimeter. There is also a slight phase shift equating to a
      time frame of less than one nanosecond.</h1>
    <h1>So the future is only a tiny fraction ahead of our reality, and a
      tiny distance away. The future is just as much a place, as a time.</h1>
    <h1>Sometimes the phases interact and seemingly odd things from the
      future phase become visible. Intelligent machines can traverse the
      phases, but organic intelligence cannot. Some of these incidents are
      regrettable, but unfortunately they do happen.</h1>
    <h1>The future really is closer than you think!</h1>
    <p><img alt="psych" src="website_images/futurepsych.jpeg" width="797"></p>
    <h1>Change</h1>
    <h1>In our current reality and timeframe, technological development is
      accelerating at a rate whereby it would seem likely that at least a
      cybernetic human body will be possible within a fifteen to twenty year
      timespan.</h1>
    <h1>People from the future would likely point out that a widening
      schizm between our psychological and personal development compared to
      technical progress, is likely to impede our potential to grow as
      individuals and as a community, since despite historical mistakes
      humans are still prone to violent conflict, and cognitive dysfunction,
      and as such we are collectively failing to learn from our past.</h1>
    <h1>Our innate dishonesty and apparent self-deception regarding being
      able to know what’s fundamentally right or wrong without prompts, is
      likely as a result of religous and political dogmatic sentiment, allied
      to our inability to subjectively critique our own human condition and
      associated behaviours.</h1>
    <h1>Continued widely held superstitious sentiment related to illogical
      belief systems will prevent us reaching higher levels of personal
      growth.</h1>
    <h1>The future paradigm has an ideology based on truth, logic, and an
      overwhelming collective concern for the happiness and wellbeing of all
      our brothers and sisters. There is a common accord, and a total
      rejection of violent actions. We prefer more enterprising activities.</h1>
    <h1>There was a price to pay, a cultural and idealogical final conflict.</h1>
    <h1>We love to live, and live to love.</h1>
    <p><img alt="future" src="website_images/future.jpg" height="109" width="229"></p>
    <p><img alt="DrEiinstein" src="website_images/drEinstein.jpg" height="708" width="525"></p>
    <h1>The harm principle</h1>
    <h1>At the future and following the religious conflict, all things
      theological are largely eradicated from our culture, along with the
      concepts of morals and ethics since these issues are largely as a
      function of sentiment, and aligned with religious ideology.</h1>
    <h1>Instead we guage the consequences of our actions and behaviour in
      terms of potential harm to ourselves and the community. This is an
      individual responsibility and understood by all members of the
      community.</h1>
    <h1>Regard for others is a big component in our daily activities.</h1>
    <h1>Your happiness is our concern, we hope you can join us.</h1>
    <p><img alt="signs" src="website_images/nowpastfuture.jpeg" height="231" width="500"></p>
    <h1>Nature</h1>
    <h1>Here at the future, we have a somewhat controversial view of
      “nature” and the natural world, that is to say the evolutionary based,
      planet earth.</h1>
    <h1>In the 21st century, we see “mother nature” as violent, and for
      many very painful, and wholly unfair with regard to the survival of the
      fittest, allied to the principles of natural selection, and the food
      chain.</h1>
    <h1>No-one deserves to be eaten!</h1>
    <h1>The pain and suffering that earthly creatures endure, we see as
      wholly unacceptable.</h1>
    <h1>We don’t see nature as sacrasanct, and as such where some see
      beauty, we see ugliness, pain and brutality. We see this as one of the
      biggest pieces of evidence against there being a “god” since no
      compassionate entity would instigate such a system.</h1>
    <h1>In the 21st century, there were many people who were against any
      idea of “tampering with nature” or “messing with god’s plan” but
      eventually we get over such concepts, take control, and embark on
      defining our own future, and reject evolutionary pressures as deciders
      of our destiny, shapers of our future form.</h1>
    <h1>In your paradigm we accept that challenging “the laws of nature” is
      tantamount to challenging a notional creator. In that sense we boldly
      re-wrote the rule book. After finally ridding ourselves of
      superstitious ideology, we became gods of our own destiny.</h1>
    <h1>That is not to say we are anti anything natural…far from it. We
      would go to extraordinary lengths to save the life of a tree for
      instance, and we think it very wrong that healthy trees are chopped
      down to make furniture, or that birds are forced to live in cages as
      pets.</h1>
    <h1>It is with great sadness, when we remember we used to consume
      others.</h1>
    <h1>Life is precious. You are precious. You are us</h1>
    <p><img alt="calamity" src="website_images/bridge.jpeg" height="328" width="499"></p>
    <h1>Date Format</h1>
    <h1>Since the dismissal of superstition, a new dating format was
      introduced which did away with the BC/AD annotation.</h1>
    <h1>Instead it was decided to start the year count at the point
      thereabouts that humans started to have a noticeable impact on the
      wider environment. This was chosen as being in the epoch called the
      Holocene, and was about 10,000 years ago. It is rather arbitary,
      however this period did see significant long term changes to the
      planet, as a result of human activities.</h1>
    <h1>At the time of this record AD2016 in the old format, the new
      notation would be 12016h.</h1>
    <h1>As we move into the Anthropocene epoch (roughly at the point of a
      sustained contained fusion reaction) the annotation would be for
      example 12016h.a+n</h1>
    <h1>It has been widely globally accepted that the Anthropocene will
      officially have started at the end of 2016, since recently a sustained
      fusion reaction in excess of thirty seconds has been maintained by
      means of a modified Tokamak (Stellarator) reactor, by a team from
      Germany.</h1>

    <h1>Quantum Conduits (communication)</h1>
    <h1>In order to explain to you the full nature of your Human condition,
      and your place in this reality, we need you to have a basic
      understanding of how you can be connected to another reality “phase”
      and therefore have the potential for distributed consciousness, that is
      to say, a remote existence.</h1>
    <h1>When we say remote, don’t forget the future is only a fraction of a
      millimeter away, so not the other side of the universe!</h1>
    <h1>We understand this may be complex and confusing, but consider a
      length of hose pipe, filled completely with marbles. If we try and push
      another marble in at one end, at exactly the same instant, a marble
      will start to emerge from the other end of the pipe.</h1>
    <h1>As far as you know, radio waves, electrons and light are limited to
      a speed of 186,000 miles per second, but I think you can agree we can
      overcome that limitation with our hose pipe scenario.</h1>
    <h1>Quantum conduits are virtual hose pipes filled with matter that
      behaves as a series of connected marbles with no gaps, at the quantum
      level.</h1>
    <h1>This is how you can be connected, and indeed, be from the future
      yourself – this is very exciting and if you think hard enough you can
      imagine all sorts of possibilities with regard to consciousness
      effectively outside of your human body.</h1>
    <h1>We will investigate this in the next instalment!</h1>
